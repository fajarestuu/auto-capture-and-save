# Automatic Capture and Save
Security have become important things. I try to make an automated capture image from camera and automatically upload to google drive using google drive API so you can track whoever
login with your laptop / computer.

# How to use

1. Rename file *config.sample.ini* with *config.ini*
2. Setting up your application in [Google API Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
3. Download the client secrets json file and change directory of client secret in *config.ini*
